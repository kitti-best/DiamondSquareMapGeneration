Capability and more nice-to-have-feature.
- This code can give you a map but still it has only 5 zone Deepsea, Sea, Sand, Greenland, Mountain.<br>
- [ ] More biome <br>
- [ ] More climate <br>
- The code cannot calculate the size to fit to screen so right.<br>
- [ ] Control map size <br>
- This code seem to lack the ability of controlling in roughness<br>
- [ ] Control roughness <br>
- You can still crash if you use weird argument so error handling is great.<br>
- [ ] Error handling <br>
