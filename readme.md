map with size of 1025 * 513

Capability and more nice to have feature.
- This code can give you a map but still it has only 5 zone Deepsea, Sea, Sand, Greenland, Mountain.<br>
  [] More biome
  [] More climate
- The code cannot caculate the size to fit to screen so right.<br>
  [] Control map size
- This code seem to lacks ability of controlling in roughness<br>
  [] Controll roughness
- You can still crash if you use weird argument so error handling is great.<br>
  [] Error handling
